  <p class="text large-spacing">
    This Christmas, we want to make giving a bit easier and more 
    meaningful. By selling Christmas cards designed by our artistic 
    team, we raise funds to support those who are less lucky and do 
    not have access to education.

    We are cooperating with UNICEF (<a href="unicef.at/interchange">unicef.at/interchange</a>) to 
    reconstruct schools in Aleppo, Syria – an area in which education 
    is needed most to avoid a vicious cycle caused by an uneducated 
    generation after the civil war. With <span class="text demi-bold">only 5€</span> (approx. 3 Christmas
    cards), you can give <span class="text demi-bold">one child</span> a future!
