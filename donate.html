Your support enables children to attend school. Your donation is used to reconstruct schools in Aleppo, Syria – a war-torn region where millions of children are out of school. The education level in Syria was high before the civil war, so the country is at risk of entering a vicious circle if an entire generation remains uneducated.

With approximately $8,000, one school which gives 1,500 children an access to education can be reconstructed together with our cooperation partner UNICEF. It costs barely more than $5 to get a child into school. If you want to find out more about the project, check out our <a href="/philantropy">Philanthropy page</a>.
