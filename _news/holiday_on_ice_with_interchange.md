**Vienna.** In January, Holiday on Ice was performing their show „Atlantis“ at the Wiener Stadthalle. The legend of the sunken island was staged as a spectacular show with breathtaking acrobatics both on the ice and in the air, with fantastic costumes and surprising effects.

From each ticket of the two Saturday-Family-Shows (on the 19th and 26th of January 2019) sold, 1€ was donated to UNICEF Austria. UNICEF offered children a play station before and during the break of the show in the foyer of Stadthalle. There they could draw, get their faces painted, apply adhesive tattoos and take home a „children’s rights booklet“.

Another highlight were the virtual reality headsets which allowed you to watch short films about the refugee camp in Austria and the current situation of the children in Syria. Initiative Interchange was supporting UNICEF with the help of its members and friends during these two days, taking care of the children and explaining to them and their parents the aim of UNICEF. Thanks to the Wiener Stadthalle we have come one step closer to our goal - primary education for everyone.
