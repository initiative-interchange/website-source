Energetic, challenging, inspiring: Over the course of the last year, we met a number of people who did incredible things, gave us the means to evolve, and contributed so much time and effort that we want to thank them. UNICEF, our strong international cooperation partner, made possible that we have a strong foundation to work towards our goal of an access to education for every child. The organization of the first global Interact conference – the Interchange the World \| 2018 Convention – and of our enchanting Artists‘ Ball „La Soirée“ to raise funds was supported by individuals and institutions from Boston to Singapore. All of these people deserve a big Thank you:

**Christa Laimer**, **Dr Gudrun Berger**, and all their supportive colleagues at **UNICEF Austria** for bearing dozens of hectic calls, e-mails, and unrealistic ideas we could still realize in the end. 

**Josip Susnjara** for his extremely generous discount on the Kursalon Wien, the breathtaking location of La Soirée, and his team for supporting us in making the evening go smoothly. 
All the guest speakers who committed to traveling to Vienna just to make the Interchange the World \| 2018 Convention an inspiring event:

**Eleanor Duckworth, PhD**, who flew over from Boston, US, to share her insights from decades at Harvard University and working with Jean Piaget.

**Dr Sidney Cambridge**, who came from Heidelberg University in Germany to give an introduction to current research in neuroscience. 

**DI Nicola Pasquero, MSc**, who spent hours discussing the Convention with us and told his story – ranging from BMW and L’Oréal to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy – at ITWC. 

**Michael Scheibenreif, PhD**, from UNICEF who shared his experience from working in Malawi and the use of drones. 

**Monika Fröhler**, the right hand of Ban Ki-Moon and CEO and leader at the Ban Ki-Moon Centre in Vienna.

Without your help, this amazing year would have never developed in such a wonderful way. We connected Interactors from more than a dozen countries and got thousands of children into school. We are very much looking forward to another round but until then, let’s have a look at our photos and videos from this year!
